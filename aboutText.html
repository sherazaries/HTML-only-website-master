		An electronic resource is any information source that the library provides access to in an electronic
		format. The library has purchased subscriptions to many electronic information resources in order to
		provide you with access to them free of charge. Computers and related electronic resources have come
		to play a central role in education. Teachers can benefit from these resources as well, by employing
		a series of useful tools. Electronic resources consist of data representing numbers, text, graphics,
		images, maps, moving images, music, sounds, etc., and programs of instruction sets.

		&nbsp;Before the development of computer and internet technology, printed version of resources like books,
		journals, dictionaries, workbooks, etc. played a significant role in teaching and learning process. 
		Therefore, of the different e-resources knowledge, e-resources development and preservation of them has 
		become the need of this hour for teacher education. E-resources and e-learning are increasingly important
		to all aspects, and all levels of education.
