		Electronic journals, also known as ejournals, e-journals, and electronic serials, are scholarly
		journals or intellectual magazines that can be accessed via electronic transmission. Some journals
		are 'born digital' in that they are solely published on the web and in a digital format, but most
		electronic journals originated as print journals, which subsequently evolved to have an electronic 
		version, while still maintaining a print component. As academic research habits have changed in line
		with the growth of the internet, the e-journal has come to dominate the journals world.

		&nbsp;With the growth and development of the internet, there has been a growth in the number of new
		journals, especially in those that exist as digital publications only. A subset of these journals exist
		as Open Access titles, meaning that they are free to access for all, and have Creative Commons licences 
		which permit the reproduction of content in different ways. High quality open access journals are listed
		in Directory of Open Access Journals. Most however continue to exist as subscription journals, for which
s		libraries, organisations and individuals purchase access.
