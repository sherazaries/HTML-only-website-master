			An electronic book, also known as an e-book or eBook, is a book publication made available
			in digital form, consisting of text, images, or both, readable on the flat-panel display of
			computers or other electronic devices. Although sometimes defined as "an electronic version
			of a printed book", some e-books exist without a printed equivalent. E-books can be read on
			dedicated e-reader devices, but also on any computer device that features a controllable viewing
			screen, including desktop computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones.

			&nbsp;As e-book formats emerged and proliferated, some garnered support from major software companies,
			such as Adobe with its PDF format that was introduced in 1993. Different e-reader devices followed different 
			formats, most of them accepting books in only one or a few formats, thereby fragmenting the e-book market even
			more. Due to the exclusiveness and limited readerships of e-books, the fractured market of independent
			publishers and specialty authors lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and selling e-books.
