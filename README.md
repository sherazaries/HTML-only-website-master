# HTML-only-website
This website is made by Me and Danish Singh Sethi(https://github.com/DanishSinghSethi/). It was made for a competition that stated in its rules that only HTML can be used. So, the website is 100% HTML and we had won 1st prize in the competition. There were some other competitiors who used CSS but still Judges and others praised us more. It was a website made when I had done web development for just one year and hence should be taken like that. I will be making some improvements to it in the future to make it look more good. And all of that will be in HTML only. Nothing else.

## Some important things to note:
* This website was made for a competition and hence the content is taken as an example and might not be truth. So, please don't rely on the content. Only see the design. We take copyrights for only the design and not for anything else.
