		An electronic dictionary is a dictionary whose data exists in digital form and can be accessed through
		a number of different media. Electronic dictionaries can be found in several forms, including software
		installed on tablet or desktop computers, mobile apps, web applications, and as a built-in function of
		E-readers. As well as Latin script, electronic dictionaries are also available in logographic and 
		right-to-left scripts, including Arabic, Persian, Gurmukhi, Chinese, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese,
		Korean, Cyrillic, and Thai.

		&nbsp;Handheld electronic dictionaries, also known as "pocket electronic dictionaries" or PEDs,
		resemble miniature clamshell laptop computers, complete with full keyboards and LCD screens. 
		Because they are intended to be fully portable, the dictionaries are battery-powered and made
		with durable casing material.Many manufacturers produce hand held dictionaries that use licensed dictionary
		content that use a database such as the Merriam Webster Dictionary and Thesaurus while others may use a
		proprietary database from their own lexicographers. Many devices can be expanded for several languages with 		the purchase of additional memory cards. 	</p> </font>
